## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Aventus is an enterprise focused, scalable, sustainable and interoperable layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum, moving to be a parachain in Q3 2022, that makes building on Polkadot, Ethereum and beyond accessible for companies in any ecosystem. To date, Aventus’ enterprise-grade modular architecture has supported use cases including NFTs, video games, loyalty schemes, event ticketing, supply chain provenance and cargo management.

This proposal aims at widening the usage of the whole Polkadot universe by making it easily accessible to business customers. Aventus is an established provider of enterprise-grade infrastructure which enables non-technical end users to engage with state-of-the-art blockchain services without needing to directly manage wallets or even own crypto, or understand it at a deep level. Instead, they can rely on facilities of their immediate service providers, who (as per this proposal) would be interacting with every Parachain via the Aventus infrastructure using standard and familiar techniques and tools.

The Aventus proposal covers several aspects that rely on the existing infrastructure and services. These services have been running in production with multiple customers. The proposal includes:

- Always-on ‘blockchain access point’ available for the general public. This would enable individuals to independently access the Polkadot ecosystem via end-user wallets and similar tools.
- An enterprise-grade programmatic API enabling business customers to build their blockchain-powered applications without the need for blockchain-specific infrastructure and development skills.
- Integration with Metamask or other wallets for an optimal user experience.
- A parachain to validate customers requests and serve them by creating transactions on any parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem.
- Integration of several active NFT marketplaces currently running on the classic Aventus network (the AvN) and Ethereum. Via the Aventus parachain, these NFTs would become interoperable across the whole ecosystem and Dotsama universes, for example allowing users to mint new NFTs on various marketplaces, auctioned off on Ethereum, and transferred via the Aventus parachain to users or projects in other parachains.


### Project Details

The architecture of the Aventus proposal is based on the following pillars:

- The Aventus Parachain itself.
- The Gateway API.
- The cloud infrastructure enabling the Gateway.

To this, we add other essential aspects and techniques:

- Integration of Polkadot with Metamask via Metamask Snaps to enable end-users to use a popular and best-of-class tool that allows easy access to multiple blockchains from browser-based apps.
- The split-fees logic from the Aventus solo-chain to enable corporate customers to pay the costs of their end-users’ transactions.
- The leveraging of the XCM format to trigger execution of transactions on different parachains by sending requests from the Aventus parachain.
- Dynamic detection and presentation of the endpoints accessible on each parachain.
- Ongoing work towards standardising NFT metadata and how to make it available off chain in a trustless way.

#### **Aventus Gateway**

The Aventus Gateway consists of a cloud infrastructure which operates both: a publicly-accessible end-point and a set of private end-points for business clients who require guaranteed levels of service. It can be reached programmatically by an API supported by JSON-RPC commands via HTTPS endpoints. Users can leverage a companion npm library that facilitates the creation of requests, authorisation and endpoint discovery, but can also implement their own logic towards constructing these requests.

At present, we have customers who demonstrated both approaches successfully. The Gateway charges fees for each transaction request, but state queries are free. These fees cover both the network operation and the expense of the relayer service’s infrastructure.

Initially, these fees will be paid in AVT, with transactions forwarded to other chains via XCMP. As part of our roadmap, we will work to further expand the service to also offer alternative approaches, for example supporting payments of transaction fees in the native currency of the target chains.

In the current Aventus solochain, we allow transfer of a wide assortment of tokens: Aventus NFTs, as well as any kind of ERC20 or ERC777 AvN tokens. These transfers are independent of the operations costs, which are always paid in AVT.

The costs are normally paid by the requester, which authorises not only the transfer of tokens as per the business transaction, but also the payment of AVT to the network and the Gateway provider.

However, the Gateway also allows the sender to specify a payer account to be responsible for paying the AVT costs, while the sender itself authorises the token (value) transfers from its own account. Thus the payer, who of course would also need to ‘agree’ to pay for the transaction, effectively finances users’ blockchain activity by maintaining and managing an appropriate AVT balance. This  enables corporate service providers to avoid having to expose end users to relatively complex blockchain technology concepts (such as “gas”, “minting fees” etc), and let end users worry only with the business case they understand. For example, ownership and buying/selling of NFTs.

#### **Aventus Parachain**

The Aventus solo-chain is the central focus of our proposal. This parachain serves as an entry point to the Polkadot ecosystem. Not only it has its own logic with its own Gateway, but by virtue of being a parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem it can therefore act as a gateway for all the other parachains.

This can be achieved by making use of the XCMP protocol and XCM message format. Our goal is to extend our proxying logic so that we can target not only endpoints (pallets and methods) present on the AvN but also any public endpoint present on other chains.

We are already experienced in managing signatures for different tasks and proxying them for processing in our chain. But we would need to research and implement the following tasks:

- A module for endpoint discovery on other chains.
- A module for signing transactions to other chains.
- A module to create requests triggering transactions on other chains.
- A module to query state of other chains.
- An extension of our polling infrastructure to monitor and report on the state of requests targeting other chains.

#### **Aventus-based enterprise blockchains**

The Aventus ecosystem features ‘corporate’ permissioned blockchains, built on Aventus technology. These chains are essentially technological replicas of the main Aventus Network, albeit with their own independent history and state. They also use AVT as their ‘fuel’ utility token. They are commissioned by enterprises and consortiums which require privacy and security of the ‘permissioned’ chain, while also avoiding siloing their assets. AvN technology wins their hearts by offering a ‘full package’ - easy to use enterprise-ready blockchain platform and middleware/API infrastructure with functionality to transfer assets out onto Ethereum or any other supported blockchain.

The longer-term vision for many of these ‘enterprise’ AvNs is to become more open and interoperable, as the applicable regulation and technology capability permit. Once the main AvN becomes a parachain of Polkadot, the natural path of evolution for ‘enterprise’ AvNs is to also become (independent) parachains, by bidding for and winning their own Polkadot parachain slots. This would greatly increase the demand for DOT, as well as bring significant additional transaction numbers into the Polkadot ecosystem.

For the period before the transition of ‘corporate’ chains into parachain, Aventus would be required to develop and maintain two versions of AvN codebase, with notable differences in the consensus layer and dependent modules. This proposal covers this effort and includes the work to transition enterprise AvNs and their infrastructure to Polkadot parachain architecture.

#### **Cloud Infrastructure**

The Aventus Gateway is supported by a dedicated scalable AWS infrastructure. It can scale horizontally thanks to a dedicated lambda-layer for processing HTTP requests and a Kubernetes layer of backend chain connectors. The two layers are connected by MessageQueue services that serve to even out demand and make requests synchronous by isolating them from the processing backend.

This is further supported by a chain indexer service which runs continuously to keep an Elastic Search record of all existing transactions. This allows us to keep an up-to-date view of the state of each Gateway request, but also keep a record of all past transactions on the chain (including the solo-chain, prior to parachain conversion).

The current proposal expects a scenario with increased traffic and infrastructure costs, but we don’t see the need for substantive changes in our architecture.

#### **Metamask Snaps - Cryptographic Infrastructure**

Metamask has become a de-facto standard in the Ethereum ecosystem to authorise and submit Ethereum transactions. End users have grown comfortable using it, and expecting the same kind of support in other ecosystems.

Originally, Metamask was restricted to Ethereum, and therefore the secp256k1 elliptic curve. This is incompatible with the elliptic curves and signature algorithms most often used by Polkadot, but Metamask Snaps allow the creation of plug-ins to support these other systems.

By employing these techniques, we would be able to leverage a familiar user interface and bring it to the Polkadot ecosystem, making it more user-friendly and thereby greatly increasing its appeal.

### Ecosystem Fit

We aim to provide a user friendly, secure and robust gateway to Polkadot and all its parachains.

Polkadot has great tools, such as polkadotJS, that allow users to interact with substrate based chains. Although these tools are great for developers and tech savvy users, their UX complexity is insurmountable for non technical users. Furthermore there is no framework and support for organisations.

As a parachain, by leveraging the power of the AVN gateway and industry accepted wallets such as metamask, we can provide all types of users with a simple access point to all parachains in the Dotsama universe.

For enterprise organisations, using our custom proxy pallet, Aventus solution will allow onboarding of their users and enable them to interact with parachains transparently, without having to directly own and manage crypto. Organisations will have options to choose from when deciding on the format of their commercial relationship with their customers. We hope this will open the door to more organisations migrating to polkadot and significantly accelerate adoption by users who may be currently discouraged by the risks and challenges of a new technology like Blockchain.

In addition to being a gateway to the wider polkadot parachain ecosystem, Aventus will bring its existing NFT capabilities and all of the live NFT marketplaces, as well as those that are currently moving to production stage. Once our work of defining a standard for storing and accessing NFT metadata is completed, our NFTs will be fully interoperable with other parachains.

## Future Plans

**Aventus** is focused on enterprise grade infrastructure and use cases, helping drive mainstream adoption of web3. Our recent business successes are across Loyalty (Cashback APP over 1m active wallets), Video games (over 600k users in our play to earn system), Aviation (national airline and one of the largest airports in the world for cargo tracking), NFTs (one of the largest independent films and the most crypto memes from it coming soon) and event ticketing (live nation). Within these categories the addressable market is enormous, we intend to grow adoption vertically and horizontally expanding to other business domains, and scale our SaaS revenue thereby supporting further development.\

The various levels at which we are seeking to innovate will drastically improve the speed at which we can drive additional deals across these key segments and give access to the amazingly diverse functionality in the polkadot ecosystem to these enterprises and beyond. We believe our entry into the Polkadot ecosystem will simultaneously deliver immediate value to our customers and to the Polkadot community, creating a virtuous circle of adoption and transaction growth, resulting in the improved business and financial architecture in multiple domains. In the long term we plan to evolve our product set and adapt to different use-cases to drive adoption of the Polkadot network across all business segments.
